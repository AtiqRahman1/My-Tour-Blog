            <p>
                Saint Martin's island, the only coral island in Bangladesh, located in the northeastern part of the Bay
                of
                Bengal, forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. St. Martin's Island is located about 9 km south of
                Teknaf in Cox's Bazar district and 8 km west of the coast of Myanmar at the mouth of the Naf River. It
                is
                also locally known as Narikel Jinjira because of the abundance of coconuts. Many years ago, in
                unfavorable
                weather conditions, an Arabian merchant ship carrying Daru Chini(Cinnamon) crashed into a huge rock
                under
                the water, causing the cinnamon to spread throughout the island, later renamed St. Martin's Island as
                'Cinnamon' Island. </p>

            <h2>Cox's Bazar</h2>
            <p>Cox's Bazar is famous for its long natural sandy sea beach. I have been to Cox's Bazar in all seasons and
                many times over the last 20 years or so. And I would love to share my practical experience with you!
                Even 20 years ago Cox's Bazar was relatively a small town. There were lots of hotels, motels and guest
                houses for tourists' accommodations and restaurants for having a variety of great food still there at
                around that time. But, over the years Cox's Bazar has been transformed into a busy tourist city. It has
                more international visitors now than ever. The availability of more recreational facilities is
                attracting more tourists every year.</p>
            <p>Cox's Bazar has the world's largest unbroken sea beach which stretches more than 120 km. The entire beach
                is a stretch of golden sandy sea beach which is reachable by motorbike. The beach gets busy from
                November to early March. If you want to avoid the herd of both domestic and international tourists, then
                the best time to take a trip there would be between April and September, preferrably April and June.</p>
